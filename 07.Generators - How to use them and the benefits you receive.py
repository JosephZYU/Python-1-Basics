because generators don't hold the entire result in memory

it yields one result at a time ðŸŒŸ

so really this is waiting for us to ask for the
next result so hasn't actually computed anything yet now

ðŸ˜Ž In most cases, we will use return () for coding interview~

ðŸ§  return: sends a specified value back to its caller
    
ðŸ§  yield: can produce a sequence of values.

We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence 
but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory.
